# Real and Fake Face Detection Model
This project aims to create a real and fake face detection model using Teachable Machine by Google. The model is trained using an open-source dataset and achieves decent accuracy in distinguishing between real and fake faces.

## Overview
With the proliferation of deepfake technology, the ability to detect real and fake faces has become increasingly important. This project leverages machine learning techniques to create a model that can differentiate between genuine and manipulated facial images.

## Features
- Utilizes Teachable Machine by Google for model creation.
- Trained on an open-source dataset of real and fake faces.
- Provides decent accuracy in distinguishing between real and fake faces.
- Can be used as a component in applications to detect fraudulent or manipulated images.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

``` git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Real-Vs-Fake-face-detection.git```

```cd Real-Vs-Fake-face-detection ```

2. Install dependencies (Keras , OpenCV & Python).

3. Run the model on your local machine or integrate it into your project.

## Dataset
The model is trained using an open-source dataset of real and fake faces. The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwingupta3012/human-faces).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue with your suggestions.

## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Google for providing the Teachable Machine platform and to the creators of the open-source dataset used for training the model.
